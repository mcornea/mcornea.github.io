<p>Hello Guys,</p>
<p>We are back online after a HDD failure of my old server which I was using for hosting Remote-Lab.net. Unfortunately I couldn't recover any of the data and because I had no backup I had to install a new server from scratch. I got an old HP Proliant Dl380 G2 server which I am currently using to host all the Remote-Lab.net servers and database. Â It is an old server and quite noisy but having 2.5GB of RAM and 2 x PIII 1.4GHz processors it handles all the tasks I use it for. And most of all it has a RAID controller with 2 HDD configured as RAID 1 so I've got all the information redundant. Hopefully I won't have any problems with this one too. I'll try to recover some of the old posts and rewrite them.</p>
<p>Sorry for the 1 week downtime !</p>
