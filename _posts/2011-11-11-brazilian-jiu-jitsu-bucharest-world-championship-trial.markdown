<p>One of my biggest passions beside computer networks is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. At the beginning of the next year my team - SoulFighters Romania will be the host of the first World Professional Jiu-Jitsu Championship Trials organized in our coutry. For every of you who are passionate about grappling it would be a good opportunity to fight great opponents and also have a great time in Bucharest.</p>
<p>You'll find more info about this in the event's official website: <a href="http://www.bjjtrial.ro">www.bjjtrial.ro</a></p>
<p>Hope we'll meet on the tatame !</p>
