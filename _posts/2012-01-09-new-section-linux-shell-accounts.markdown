<p>2012 starts with a new section on Remote-Lab - the Linux shell accounts. This is an old wish of mine since the time of mIRC, IRC servers and dial up connections when having a shell account where you could compile and run a psyBNC process was a privilege.</p>
<p>Well, you may now get a free linux shell account on the virtualization server by filling in the registration form and I hope it's not for the purposes mentioned above :) ( access is also restricted locally Â )<br />
As you may know from the Lab Gear section the virtualization server is a machine running Ubuntu 11.10 OS where you can have your shell account to practice your skills with various scripting languages like bash, perl or python.</p>
<p>I am also considering installing a mysql database server so that you can play with operations over databases. At this time this isn't implemented but I'll let you know once you can test it.</p>
