Spring has finally arrived and with it came the perfect opportunity for some home lab maintenance. After running my home lab OKD instance reliably for over 2 years, I recently performed a reinstall and decided to document the entire process. Since the previous setup served me well, I wanted to capture all the detailed steps involved in getting a fresh OKD environment up and running on a KVM virtual machine.

## Prerequisites

OKD is a community distribution of Kubernetes which serves as the upstream project for Red Hat OpenShift. For this installation, I'll demonstrate the [agent based method](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.18/installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.html), which offers a streamlined approach suitable for both bare metal servers and virtual machines. The installation process follows a straightforward workflow: creating configuration files, generating an installation ISO, booting nodes with this ISO, and monitoring the automated installation to completion.

Before proceeding with the installation, let's ensure the following requirements are in place:

### Hypervisor Environment
I'm using CentOS Stream as the hypervisor host(the large NUC box in the lab image) with libvirt for virtual machine management. The OKD node will be provisioned with the following specifications:
- 16GB RAM
- 8 vCPUs
- 500GB storage
- single network interface with static IPv4 address connected to a bridge device linked to the lab network

We'll use the `virt-install` tool to create this VM after generating the installation ISO (detailed instructions provided later in this guide).

### DNS Configuration
OKD requires specific DNS records to enable external access to the cluster's API and ingress services. In my environment, I'm using AdGuard as the DNS server with the following records configured in the "Filters â†’ DNS rewrites" section:

```
api.k8s.cornea.dev    A    172.16.1.24
*.apps.k8s.cornea.dev A    172.16.1.24
```

These DNS entries ensure proper routing to the single-node OKD cluster services once installation is complete.

## OKD Installation Steps

### Preparing Configuration Files


#### Create install-config.yaml

Create an [install-config.yaml](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.18/installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.html#installation-bare-metal-agent-installer-config-yaml_preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer) file for your OKD installation. The documentation provides comprehensive details on all available parameters, but pay special attention to:

- `baseDomain` and `metadata.name`: These must correspond to your DNS records
- `networking.machineNetwork`: This should match your lab network subnet
- Include your public SSH key to enable secure access to the node both during installation and afterward

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: cornea.dev
compute:
- architecture: amd64
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: worker
  replicas: 0
controlPlane:
  architecture: amd64
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: master
  replicas: 1
metadata:
  name: k8s
networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.132.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  machineNetwork:
  - cidr: 172.16.1.0/24
  networkType: OVNKubernetes
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16
platform:
  none: {}
sshKey: ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza...
pullSecret: '{"auths":{"fake":{"auth":"aWQ6cGFzcwo="}}}'
```

#### Create agent-config.yaml

Now, let's create the [agent-config.yaml](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.18/installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.html#agent-host-config_preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer) file. In this example, we'll primarily use it for the network configuration and hostname. It utilizes the Nmstate configuration schema, providing significant flexibility for configuring network interfaces in various ways to match your environment needs.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: AgentConfig
metadata:
  name: k8s
rendezvousIP: 172.16.1.24
hosts:
- hostname: k8s.cornea.dev
  rootDeviceHints:
    deviceName: "/dev/sda"
  interfaces:
  - macAddress: 52:54:00:54:7d:2b
    name: enp1s0
  networkConfig:
    dns-resolver:
      config:
        server:
        - 172.16.1.13
        - 172.16.1.15
    interfaces:
    - ethernet:
        auto-negotiation: true
        duplex: full
        speed: 1000
      ipv4:
        address:
        - ip: 172.16.1.24
          prefix-length: 24
        enabled: true
      ipv6:
        enabled: false
      mac-address: 52:54:00:54:7d:2b
      mtu: 1500
      name: enp1s0
      state: up
      type: ethernet
    routes:
      config:
      - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
        next-hop-address: 172.16.1.1
        next-hop-interface: enp1s0
        table-id: 254
```

### Download openshift-client-linux from okd-scos [release page](https://github.com/okd-project/okd-scos/releases)

### Extract openshift-install binary 

```bash
oc adm release extract --command=openshift-install quay.io/okd/scos-release:4.18.0-okd-scos.3
```

### Create installation directory and copy install-config.yaml and agent-config.yaml files

```bash
mkdir install
cp install-config.yaml agent-config.yaml install/
```

### Generate the installation ISO

```bash
./openshift-install agent create image --dir install
INFO Configuration has 1 master replicas and 0 worker replicas 
INFO The rendezvous host IP (node0 IP) is 172.16.1.24 
INFO Consuming Install Config from target directory 
INFO Consuming Agent Config from target directory 
INFO Generated ISO at install/agent.x86_64.iso.
```

### Copy the ISO to a location accessible by the VM 

In my case I am going to use /var/lib/libvirt/images on the hypervisor.

```bash
cp install/agent.x86_64.iso /var/lib/libvirt/images/k8s.iso
```

### Create the VM

* Note that the MAC address must match the MAC address in the agent-config.yaml file.

```bash
virt-install \
  --osinfo centos-stream9 \
  --name k8s \
  --memory 16384 \
  --vcpus 8 \
  --cpu host-passthrough \
  --disk /var/lib/libvirt/images/k8s.qcow2,size=500,bus=scsi \
  --network bridge=external,mac=52:54:00:54:7d:2b \
  --cdrom /var/lib/libvirt/images/k8s.iso \
  --boot hd,cdrom \
  --autostart \
  --noautoconsole

Starting install...
Allocating 'k8s.qcow2'  | 500 GB  00:00:03
Creating domain...      |         00:00:00     

Domain is still running. Installation may be in progress.
You can reconnect to the console to complete the installation process.

```

At this point, you can access the console using `virt-viewer` or `virt-manager` to verify that the node has successfully booted from the ISO. You should see an output similar to this:  
<a href="{{'/public/images/okd_console.png' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}"><img src="{{'/public/images/okd_console.png' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" alt="OKD Console" width="800" height="250"/></a>

You should also be able to SSH to the node using the ssh key you provided in the `install-config.yaml` file and the `core` user:

```bash
ssh core@k8s.cornea.dev

The primary service is assisted-service.service. To watch its status, run:

  journalctl -u assisted-service.service
This host (172.16.1.24) is the rendezvous host.
Last login: Sun Mar  9 10:37:44 2025 from 192.168.86.44
[core@k8s ~]$ 

```

### Wait for the bootstrap process to complete

Now, let's return to the installation directory where we created the ISO image to monitor the progress of the installation:  

```bash
./openshift-install agent wait-for bootstrap-complete --dir install

INFO Bootstrap configMap status is complete       
INFO Bootstrap is complete

```

* Note that during the bootstrap process, the installer will trigger a reboot to ensure that the node boots from the installation drive instead of the CD-ROM device. I've observed that occasionally the VM may not power on after the reboot is initiated. In such cases, ensure that the VM is powered on and is booting from the installation drive. You can power on the VM using the `virsh start <vm_name>` command.  

### Wait for the remaining installation process to complete:

```bash
./openshift-install agent wait-for install-complete --dir install 
INFO Bootstrap Kube API Initialized               
INFO Bootstrap configMap status is complete       
INFO Bootstrap is complete

```

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=install/auth/kubeconfig 

oc get clusterversion

```

## Known Issues

As of this writing, there are two documented issues requiring workarounds during installation. These are fully detailed in the [OKD project GitHub discussion #2035](https://github.com/okd-project/okd/discussions/2035):

1. The bootstrap live ISO image must be manually overridden to use RHCOS
2. The assisted-service database requires manual intervention with `pg_ctl start`

Be sure to review the linked discussion before beginning your installation to understand the specific workaround procedures.
