<p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>Today I have been trying to get some working console cables for the Asus WL-500 routers I have. The first thing I tried was using an old Nokia CA-42 data cable which includes an Prolific USB to 3.3V TTL converter but unfortunately it ended in getting a messy input and output. So the other solution I thought of was building my own RS232-to-3.3V TTL converter.<br />
Below you may find a scheme of the simplest converter I found. </p>

<p>You will need the following components to build it:<br />
2 x BC337 transistors<br />
1 x 1.5K resistor<br />
1 x 22K resistor<br />
1 x 4.7K resistor<br />
1 x 3.9K resistor<br />
1 x DB9 female connector</p>
<p>This converter did the job for me but only when using it with a computer which had a built-in serial port. When trying it with an USB-to-RS232 converter (Prolific chipset) I got a clean output from the UART port of the router but a messy input. I guess I'll have to try another type of USB-RS232 converter(other chipset than Prolific) or build an USB-to-3.3V TTL converter from scratch.<br />
I am also attaching a document containing a complete list of RS232-to-3.3V TTL converters:<br />

<p>Later Edit: I found a workaround for the messy input when using an USB-to-serial adapter. The default OpenWRT image is compiled with a default baud rate of 115200 bps for the console port. You need to recompile the kernel and use a baud rate of 9600 bps, I will later post a tutorial on how this should be done. </p>
