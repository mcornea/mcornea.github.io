<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>A nice tip I found about today is how to get rid of the space scrolling when showing a config, log, etc. This may be useful when you want to copy the configuration to a text editor and you don't want to press space so many times to scroll until the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p><code lang="c[notools]">Router#terminal length 0</code></p>
<p>and to have it back to the initial settings:</p>
<p><code lang="c[notools]">Router#terminal length 24</code></p>
