In order the prevent certain modules from being loaded by the kernel using the grub command line you need to pass them as a parameter to the &nbsp;kernel line using the below syntax. It can be useful when you cannot access the OS file system so that you can edit a blacklist with the modules you don't want to be loaded&nbsp;</p>
<p><code lang="c[notools]"> module_name.blacklist=yes</code></p>
