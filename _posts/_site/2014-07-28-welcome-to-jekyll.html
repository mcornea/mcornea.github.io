<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. Here is a little quote from the official website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> (or <a href="http://redcloth.org/textile">Textile</a>) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.
