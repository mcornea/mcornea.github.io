My name is Marius and probably like most of you who are viewing this website I am passionate about computer networks.

I started this project more as a need to develop my networking knowledge after graduating college. Since I dind’t have any working experience the lab hands-on activity was great for developing my skills.

Since then I’ve been working as a Linux sysadmin and got pretty amazed of how powerful this OS and all the tools in the open source ecosystem can be. This is why I decided to replace the old Cisco 3550 switches laboratory with Linux virtualized devices and focus on software defined networking. I really love the concept of decoupling the data and control plane and believe that running the latter on an x86 machine would bring you enormous possibilities.
